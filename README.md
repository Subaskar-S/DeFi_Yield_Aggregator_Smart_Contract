# 🚀 DeFi Yield Aggregator DApp

A comprehensive decentralized application that aggregates yields from multiple DeFi protocols including Compound, Aave, and Uniswap V2. The system automatically optimizes fund allocation across strategies to maximize returns while providing users with a simple interface to deposit and withdraw funds.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **YieldVault** - Main vault contract that manages user deposits and strategy allocations
2. **BaseStrategy** - Abstract base contract for all yield farming strategies
3. **Strategy Implementations**:
   - CompoundStrategy - Lends tokens on Compound Finance
   - AaveStrategy - Lends tokens on Aave V2
   - UniswapV2Strategy - Provides liquidity to Uniswap V2 pairs
4. **React Frontend** - User interface for interacting with the vault

### Key Features

- ✅ **Multi-Protocol Integration**: Supports Compound, Aave, and Uniswap V2
- ✅ **Automated Rebalancing**: Optimizes fund allocation across strategies
- ✅ **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality and emergency withdrawals
- ✅ **ERC-4626 Compatible**: Standard vault tokenization pattern
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with integration tests
- ✅ **Modern Frontend**: React UI with Web3 integration
- ✅ **Security Features**: Reentrancy protection, access controls, upgradability

```

## 📊 Smart Contract Details

### YieldVault

The main vault contract that:
- Accepts user deposits and mints shares
- Manages strategy allocations and rebalancing
- Handles emergency controls and pausing
- Implements ERC-4626 standard for vault tokenization

Key functions:
- `deposit(assets, receiver)` - Deposit tokens and receive shares
- `withdraw(assets, receiver, owner)` - Withdraw tokens by burning shares
- `addStrategy(strategy, allocation)` - Add new yield strategy
- `rebalance()` - Rebalance funds across strategies
- `harvestAll()` - Harvest rewards from all strategies

### BaseStrategy

Abstract base contract providing:
- Common strategy functionality
- Access controls and security features
- Performance fee management
- Emergency controls

### Strategy Implementations

1. **CompoundStrategy**: Lends tokens to Compound Finance
   - Mints cTokens to earn interest
   - Claims COMP rewards
   - Handles exchange rate fluctuations

2. **AaveStrategy**: Lends tokens to Aave V2
   - Deposits to lending pool for aTokens
   - Earns variable interest rates
   - Supports instant withdrawals

3. **UniswapV2Strategy**: Provides liquidity to Uniswap V2
   - Adds liquidity to token pairs
   - Earns trading fees
   - Manages impermanent loss risk

## 🎨 Frontend Features

### Components

1. **WalletConnection**: MetaMask integration and wallet management
2. **VaultDashboard**: Overview of vault statistics and user position
3. **DepositWithdraw**: Interface for depositing and withdrawing funds
4. **StrategyOverview**: Display of active strategies and allocations

### Key Features

- 🔗 **Wallet Integration**: Seamless MetaMask connection
- 📊 **Real-time Data**: Live APY and balance updates
- 💰 **Easy Transactions**: Simple deposit/withdraw interface
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual contract functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-contract interactions
- **Strategy Tests**: Each strategy implementation
- **Gas Optimization**: Gas usage analysis

Run tests:
```bash
npm test                    # All tests
npm run test:gas           # With gas reporting
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Access Controls**: Owner-only functions for critical operations
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for emergency situations
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Slippage Protection**: Configurable slippage tolerance

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient contract design
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple operations in single transaction
- **IR Compilation**: Uses Solidity IR for better optimization
