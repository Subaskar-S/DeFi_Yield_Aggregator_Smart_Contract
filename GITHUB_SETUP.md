# 📚 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup (After Compilation Fixed)

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: DeFi Yield Aggregator DApp

- Complete smart contract architecture with Vault and Strategies
- React frontend with Web3 integration
- Comprehensive test suite
- Multi-protocol support (Compound, Aave, Uniswap V2)
- ERC-4626 compatible vault tokenization
- Emergency controls and security features"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name: `defi-yield-aggregator`
3. Description: `A comprehensive DeFi yield aggregator supporting Compound, Aave, and Uniswap V2 with automated rebalancing`
4. Make it public
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 3. Connect and Push
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/defi-yield-aggregator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
